# asgn-files

We have provided some files for you to use when completing this assignment. The files can be
found in the directory /home/cshome/coursework/242/asgn-files/ and are as follows:

- print-stats.txt — contains extra functions which you should add to your htable files.
- sample-asgn — an executable, compiled on Linux, which you can use to see if your
program is working correctly. If your program is correct then it should produce exactly
the same output as the sample program.
